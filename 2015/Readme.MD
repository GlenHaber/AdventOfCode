These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2015, a project which I used to learn the Scala language. The exception was day 12, which I solved in Python, due to the problem's nature involving JSON input, which is far more easily parsed with Python's native libraries.

Problem definitions may be found at [adventofcode.com/2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015). All of these problems are in two parts, and the second appears only after submitting a correct solution to the first.
