# AdventOfCode
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about) is an annual set of online programming challenges started in December 2015. These are my solutions to those challenges.

In late 2015, I was tasked with converting a Hadoop project to Spark, so I needed to learn Scala. I used Advent of Code for this purpose. As such, the 2015 folder represents my progress in learning a new language over the course of a few weeks.

I completed the challenge again in 2016, this time in Python, which has been my most active language since early 2015.
